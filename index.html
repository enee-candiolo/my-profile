				<h2>My hobbies</h2>
				<p>One of my main hobbies is travelling, discovering new countries, cultures and people. Therefore i traveled a lot, alone, with friends or family. It has come to sense for me to take part into CISV which is an organization that promote peace by organizing camps in which children from all aorund the world meet,  build connections, learn about each other culture and learn to respect differences.
				<br>I am also fond of sports, litterature, music, mode, beauty and luxe.</br></p>
